    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how Phrases Media (“we”, “us”, “our”) handles information
        when you use this website and the tools linked from it. The tools are intended for
        general information and convenience only.
    </p>

    <h2>Personal information</h2>
    <p>
        This site does not require you to create an account or log in. In general, you can browse
        the website without telling us who you are. If you choose to contact us by email, we
        will receive the information you decide to share in that message (such as your name and
        email address). We will only use that information to respond to your enquiry and to
        improve the tools and site.
    </p>

    <h2>Information entered into tools</h2>
    <p>
        Some tools on this site, or linked from this site, ask you to enter figures such as
        income, leave amounts, service length, or other details in order to perform calculations.
        These values are processed in your browser for the purpose of showing you results. They
        are not used to personally identify you.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies and third-party services</h2>
    <p>
        This website may use cookies or similar technologies to help improve performance,
        understand basic usage, or show advertising. Advertising partners, including Google,
        may use cookies to serve ads based on your visits to this and other sites.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>
        We may display third-party advertisements on this website, including Google AdSense.
        These providers may use cookies or other identifiers to show ads that are relevant to
        your interests. You can manage your ad personalisation settings through Google and other
        advertising platforms directly.
    </p>

    <h2>Links to other sites</h2>
    <p>
        Phrases Media links out to external sites and browser extension stores to host and
        distribute tools. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those
        external websites. You should review the privacy policies of any site you visit.
    </p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
        This site and its tools are intended for adults. They are not aimed at children under
        the age of 13.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as the site or tools change. The
        updated version will be posted on this page with a revised date.
    </p>
