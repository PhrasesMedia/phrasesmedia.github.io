        <h3>Redundancy Ray</h3>
        <p>
            Redundancy Ray helps people estimate their redundancy payout and understand how far it
            might go. It can show a simple breakdown of payments and give a rough idea of how long
            a payout could support mortgage repayments. It’s designed for Australians who want a
            clear view during a stressful time.

        <h3>BabyPay</h3>
        <p>
            BabyPay is for parents planning time off work. It brings together government parental
            leave, employer-paid leave, and estimated after-tax income, so families can see what
            their income might look like over the months around a new baby. The goal is to make
            it easier to plan ahead with fewer surprises.

        <h3>Simple Flow</h3>
        <p>
            Simple Flow turns a list of steps into a flowchart automatically. As you write out the
            process, the chart is drawn for you. It’s useful for documenting procedures,
            training new team members, or just untangling a messy process visually.

        <h3>AfterTaxTim</h3>
        <p>
            AfterTaxTim is a browser extension that reads salary figures on job listings and shows
            an estimate of the after-tax income. It is designed for people who want to see what a
            salary might actually mean in their bank account each month, without needing to open a
            separate calculator.

            Roster Mate is a roster viewer that makes multi-week rosters easier to read. It can
            highlight pay days and show patterns over several weeks, so staff can see their shifts
            and key dates at a glance.

            times, including the steps involved (for example, walk → train → bus). It’s designed
            to help people quickly see which option makes the most sense for their day.

        <h3>Home Time</h3>
        <p>
            Home Time is an idea for a browser extension that shows how long it would take to get
            home right now, based on live travel times and timetables. It’s aimed at people who
            finish work at different times and want a quick answer to “what time would I be home if
            I left now?”.

        <h3>Screen Drop</h3>
        <p>
            Screen Drop is a planned screenshot helper that would capture a screen, make it easy to
            share, and automatically delete the file after a short period. The idea is to keep
            things tidy while still making it simple to show someone exactly what you’re seeing.
